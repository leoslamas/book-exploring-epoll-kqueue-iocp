# Express conclusion

By just running through our express examples you get an overview over what `Kqueue`, `Epoll` and `IOCP` looks like in real life.

I know it's not a fair comparison based on our express examples since they're so extensively commentated, but in my experience, IOCP is more verbose than the two others and requires a lot more setup to get working. This will be especially apparent when we go through the code in part 2 of our book.

However, even though they're all pretty well documented, IOCP has arguably the best documentation of them. Go and have a look at the [IOCP](../appendix-1/iocp.md), [Epoll](../appendix-1/epoll.md) and [Kqueue](../appendix-1/kqueue.md) reference pages in the appendix and have a look yourself.

They all work well and have their advantages and disadvantages. The real difficulties start when trying to unite all three into one API to use as a cross platform library.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that while `Kqueue` is used on all BSD based operating systems, there seems to be some subtle differences in flag and constant values between the `macos` version and the one for `FreeBSD`. Just keep this in mind if you're not using a crate which provides these constants and definitions for you already like the [libc crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc) does.

Creating a cross platform event queue is exactly what the next part of this book will go through.
